# README

This directory provides type definitions for popular ASH scripts.

## Adding a type definition

If you want to submit a new type definition, ensure that the definition file name matches the spelling of the _ASH file name_. (e.g. `zlib.ash.d.ts` instead of `Zlib.ash.d.ts`)

Use the following template as a starting point:

```ts
/**
 * @file Type definition for <script name>, made by <original author name>.
 *
 * - ASH script name: <script name>
 * - ASH script version: <version or revision, e.g. 2.3.0 or r42>
 * - ASH script authors: <Comma-separated list of authors and maintainers>
 *
 * Links:
 *  - ASH script forum thread: <Add URL or remove this line>
 *  - ASH script repository: <Add URL or remove this line>
 */

// Add type definitions below and delete this comment
```
